Alma the Younger's use of prophetic forms in this sermon are notably softer
than those usually used by other prophets. For example, instead of saying "thus
saith the Lord," Alma attributes his reveleations to the Spirit, saying, "thus
saith the Spirit." He also lists many sins, without explicitly saying "wo" each
time. Even his proclamations are less direct.
