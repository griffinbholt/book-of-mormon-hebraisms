# Symbolic Action as Prophetic Curse or Token of a Covenant

## Mosiah 1:11-12; 5:2-12; 6:1

*   1:11) And moreover, **I shall give this people a name**...
*   1:12) And **I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except
it be through transgression**...
*   5:2) And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the
words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and
truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty
change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil,
but to do good continually.
*   5:3) And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the
manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and
were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.
*   5:4) And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our king has
spoken unto us that has brought us to this great knowledge, whereby we do
rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.
*   5:5) And **we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God** to do his
will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall
command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves
a never-ending torment, as has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink
out of the cup of the wrath of God.
*   5:6) And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and
therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the
covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.
*   5:7) And now, **because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called
the children of Christ**, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he
hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through
faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and
his daughters.
*   5:8) And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head
whereby ye can be made free. **There is no other name given whereby salvation
cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all
you that have entered into the covenant with God** that ye should be obedient unto
the end of your lives.
*   5:9) And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at
the right hand of God, **for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he
shall be called by the name of Christ**.
*   5:10) And now it shall come to pass, that **whosoever shall not take upon him
the name of Christ must be called by some other name**; therefore, he findeth
himself on the left hand of God.
*   5:11) And I would that ye should remember also, that **this is the name that
I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be
through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the
name be not blotted out of your hearts.**
*   5:12) I say unto you, I would that ye should **remember to retain the name
written always in your hearts**, that ye are not found on the left hand of God,
but that **ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the
name by which he shall call you.**
*   6:1) And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished
speaking to the people, that **he should take the names of all those who had
entered into a covenant with God to keep his commandments.**

## Alma 24:6-7,12-13,15-19

*   v. 6) Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted
unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would
not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them
that they should not.
*   v. 7) Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the
matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness
sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to
convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers...
*   v. 12) ...**Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains,
and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with
the blood of our brethren.**
*   v. 13) Behold, I say unto you, Nay, **let us retain our swords that they be
not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our
swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of
our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins**...
*   v. 15) ...Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, **since it has been as
much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are
made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony
to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand
before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of
our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.**
*   v. 16) And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, **behold, we
will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that
they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the
last day**; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and
shall be saved.
*   v. 17) And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these
sayings, and **all the people were assembled together, they took their swords,
and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they
did bury them up deep in the earth.**
*   v. 18) **And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and
also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's
blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than
shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather
than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend
their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.**
*   v. 19) And **thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe
and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather
than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or
they buried the weapons of war, for peace.**

## Alma 44:12-15

*   v. 12) And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his
sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay
Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni’s soldiers smote it
even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and **he also smote Zerahemnah that
he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth**. And Zerahemnah withdrew from
before them into the midst of his soldiers.
*   v. 13) And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the
scalp of Zerahemnah, **took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and
laid it upon the point of his sword**, and stretched it forth unto them, saying
unto them with a loud voice:
*   v. 14) **Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of
your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your
weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace.**
*   v. 15) Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp
which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and **many came forth and
threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a
covenant of peace**. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to 
depart into the wilderness.

## Alma 46:19-24,26

*   v. 19) And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people,
**waving the rent part of his garment in the air**, that all might see the writing
which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:
*   v. 20) Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them
come forth in the strength of the Lord, and **enter into a covenant** that they will
maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.
*   v. 23) Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob;
yea, **we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his
brethren into many pieces**; yea, and now behold, **let us remember to keep the
commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren**, and we be
cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.
*   v. 24) Yea, **let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph**; yea, let us
remember the words of Jacob, before his death, **for behold, he saw that a part of
the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed**. And he
said—**Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a 
remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto
himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the
remnant of his garment.**
*   v. 26) And **now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which
shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us?** Yea, and even
it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.

## Alma 46:21-22

*   v. 21) And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words,
behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their
loins, **rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not
forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the
commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon
them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their
garments**.
*   v. 22) Now this was the covenant which they made, and **they cast their
garments at the feet of Moroni**, saying: We covenant with our God, that we
shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall
into transgression; **yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we
have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall
into transgression.**

## 3 Nephi 4:28-33

*   v. 28) And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea,
even upon the top thereof until he was dead. **And when they had hanged him until
he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth**, and did cry with a loud voice,
saying:
*   v. 29) **May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of
heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay
them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been
felled to the earth.**
*   v. 30) And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people
in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.
*   v. 31) And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing,
and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in
preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.
*   v. 32) Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry:
Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.
*   v. 33) And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many
tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands
of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their
humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.
