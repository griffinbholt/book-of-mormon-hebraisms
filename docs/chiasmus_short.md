## 1 Nephi 3:3-12

*   A. For behold, **Laban** hath the record of the Jews and also **a genealogy of my forefathers**, **they are engraven upon plates of brass.**
    *   B. Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers **should go unto the house of Laban**, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.
        *   C. And now, behold **thy brothers murmur**, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.
            *   D. Therefore **go, my son**,
                *   E. and **thou shalt be favored of the Lord**, because thou hast not murmured.
                    *   F. And it came to pass that **I, Nephi, said unto my father**:
                        *   G. I will **go and do the things**
                            *   H. which **the Lord hath commanded**,
                            *   H. for I know that **the Lord giveth no commandments** unto the children of men,
                        *   G. save he shall prepare a way for them that they may **accomplish the thing** which he commandeth them.
                    *   F. And it came to pass that when **my father had heard these words** he was exceedingly glad,
                *   E. for he knew that **I had been blessed of the Lord**.
            *   D. And **I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey** in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that when **we had gone** up to the land of Jerusalem,
        *   C. **I and my brethren did consult one with another**.
    *   B. And we cast lots—who of us **should go in unto the house of Laban**. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman **went in unto the house of Laban**, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.
*   A. And he desired of **Laban** the records which were **engraven upon the plates of brass**, which contained **the genealogy of my father**.

## 1 Nephi 4:33-35

*   A. And **I spake** unto him, even with an oath,
    *   B. that **he need not fear**;
        *   C. that he should **be a free man like unto us**
            *   D. **if he would go down in the wilderness** with us.
                *   E. And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely **the Lord hath commanded us**
                    *   F. to **do this thing**;
                    *   F. and shall we not **be diligent**
                    E. in keeping the **commandments of the Lord**?
            *   D. Therefore, **if thou wilt go down into the wilderness** to my father
        *   C. **thou shalt have place with us**.
    *   B. And it came to pass that **Zoram did take courage**
*   A. at the words which **I spake**.

## 1 Nephi 13:39-42

*   A. And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto them, **unto the convincing of the Gentiles** and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, **and also the Jews**
    *   B. who were scattered upon **all the face of the earth**,
        *   C. that **the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb** are true. And the angel spake unto me, saying:
            *   a. These last records,
                *   b. which thou hast seen among the Gentiles,
            *   a. shall establish the truth of the first,
                *   b. which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, 
            *   D. and **shall make known** the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and **shall make known** to all kindreds, tongues, and people,
                *   E. that **the Lamb** of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world;
                    *   F. and that **all men must come** unto him, or they cannot be saved.
                    *   F. And **they must come**
                *   E. according to the words which shall be established by the mouth of **the Lamb**; and the words of **the Lamb**
            *   D. **shall be made known**
        *   C. in **the records of thy seed, as well as in the records of the twelve apostles of the Lamb**; wherefore they both shall be established in one;
    *   B. for there is one God and one Shepherd over **all the earth**.
*   A. And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all nations, **both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles**;

## 1 Nephi 17:5-6

*   A. And we did come to **the land which we called Bountiful, because of its much fruit** and also wild honey; and all these things were prepared of the Lord that we might not perish.
    *   B. And we beheld **the sea**, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is **many waters**. And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by **the seashore**;
        *   C. and notwithstanding we had suffered **many afflictions** and **much difficulty**,
        *   C. yea, even **so much** that we cannot write them all,
    *   B. we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to **the seashore**;
*   A. and **we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit**

## 1 Nephi 17:35-38 (see also [Parallelism](parallelism.md#1-nephi-1735-39-antithetical--coordinating---see-also-chiasmus))

*   A. Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; **he that is righteous is favored of God**.
    *   B. But behold, **this people** had rejected every word of God, and they were **ripe in iniquity**; and the fulness of **the wrath of God was upon them**; the Lord did **curse the land against them**,
        *   C. and **bless it** unto **our fathers**;
            *   D. yea, he did curse it against them unto **their destruction**,
                *   E. and he did bless it unto **our fathers** unto their **obtaining power over it**.
                    *   F. Behold, the Lord hath created **the earth**
                        *   G. that it should **be inhabited**;
                        *   G. and he hath created **his children**
                    *   F. that they should possess **it**.
                *   E. And **he raiseth up** a **righteous nation**,
            *   D. and **destroyeth** the nations of **the wicked**.
        *   C. And he leadeth away **the righteous** into **precious lands**,
    *   B. and **the wicked** he **destroyeth**, and **curseth the land unto them** for their sakes.
*   A. He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this earth is his footstool. And **he loveth those who will have him to be their God**

## 2 Nephi 1:5-7

*   A. But, said he, notwithstanding our **afflictions**,
    *   B. we have obtained **a land of promise**,
    *   B. **a land which is choice** above all other lands;
    *   B. **a land which the Lord God hath covenanted** with me should be
    *   B. **a land for the inheritance of my seed**.
        *   C. Yea, **the Lord hath [consecrated] this land** unto me, and to my children forever, ("consecrated" - in the original manuscript)
            *   D. and also **all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord**.
                *   E. Wherefore, **I, Lehi, prophesy**
                *   E. according to the **workings of the Spirit** which is in **me**,       
            *   D. that **there shall none come into this land** save they shall be brought **by the hand of the Lord**.
        *   C. Wherefore, **this land is consecrated** unto him whom he shall bring.
    *   B. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be **a land of liberty** unto them;
*   A. wherefore, they shall never be **brought down into captivity**;

## 2 Nephi 9:20

*   A. For he **knoweth**
    *   B. **all things**,
    *   B. and there is **not anything**
*   A. save he **knows** it.

## 2 Nephi 25:24-27

*   A. And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, **we keep the law of Moses**,
    *   B. and look forward with steadfastness unto **Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled**.
        *   C. For, **for this end was the law given**;
            *   D. wherefore **the law hath become dead** unto us, and **we are made alive in Christ** because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.
                *   E. And we *talk* of **Christ**, we *rejoice* in **Christ**, we *preach* of **Christ**, we **prophesy** of **Christ**,
                *   E. and we *write* according to our **prophecies**, that our children may know **to what source they may look for a remission of their sins**.
            *   D. Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may know **the deadness of the law**; and they, by knowing **the deadness of the law**, may look forward unto **that life which is in Christ**,
        *   C. and know **for what end the law was given**.
    *   B. And **after the law is fulfilled in Christ**,
*   A. that they need not harden their hearts against him when **the law ought to be done away**.

## 2 Nephi 29:3-6

*   A. And because my words shall hiss forth—many of **the Gentiles** shall say:
    *   B. i. **A Bible! A Bible!**
        *   ii. **We have got a Bible,**
            *   iii. and **there cannot be any more Bible**.
        *   C. But thus saith the Lord God: **O fools**, they shall have a Bible;
            *   D. and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, **mine ancient covenant people**. And **what thank they the Jews** for the Bible which they receive from them?
                *   E. i. Yea, what do the **Gentiles** mean?
                    *   ii. **Do they remember**
                        *   iii. the travails, and the labors, and the pains of **the Jews**, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?
                *   E. O ye **Gentiles**,
                    *   ii. **have ye remembered**
                        *   iii. the Jews,
            *   D. **mine ancient covenant people**? Nay; but **ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them**. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten **my people.**
        *   C. **Thou fool**, that shall say:
    *   B. i. **A Bible**,
        *   ii. **we have got a Bible**,
            *   iii. and **we need no more Bible.**
*   A. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by **the Jews**?

## Mosiah 2:5-6

*   A. And it came to pass that when they came up to **the temple**,
    *   B. they **pitched their tents round about**,
        *   C. every man according to his **family**,
            *   D. consisting of his wife, and his **sons**, and his **daughters**,
            *   D. and their **sons**, and their **daughters**, from the eldest down to the youngest,
        *   C. every **family** being separate from one another.
    *   B. And they **pitched their tents round about**
*   A. **the temple**

## Mosiah 2:31-41

*   A.  And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done. As ye have **kept my commandments**, and also **the commandments** of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall **keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God** which shall be delivered unto you by him,
    *   B. **ye shall prosper** in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.
        *   C. But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise **contentions** among you, and ye **list to obey the evil spirit**, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah. For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who **listeth to obey that spirit**; for if he **listeth to obey him**, and **remaineth and dieth** in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to **his own soul**; for he receiveth for his wages an **everlasting punishment**,
            *   D. having **transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge**.
                *   E. I say unto you, hat there are not any among you, except it be your little children **that have not been taught concerning these things**,
                    *   F. **but what knoweth** that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father,
                        *   G. to render to him all that you **have and are**;
                            *   H. and also have been taught concerning the records which contain **the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets**, even down to the time **our father, Lehi**, left Jerusalem;
                            *   H. And also, **all that has been spoken by our fathers until now**. And behold, also, **they spake** that which was commanded them of the Lord; 
                        *   G. therefore, they are **just and true**.
                    *   F. And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that **after ye have known** and 
                *   E. **have been taught all these things**,
            *   D. if ye should **transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken**, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom’s paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved—
        *   C. I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open **rebellion** against God; therefore he **listeth to obey the evil spirit**, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples. Therefore if that man repenteth not, and **remaineth and dieth** an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken **his immortal soul** to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable gfire, whose flame ascendeth up **forever and ever**. And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a **never-ending torment**. O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.
    *   B. And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on **the blessed and happy state** of those
*   A. that **keep the commandments of God**. 

## Mosiah 3:18-19

*   A. They **humble** themselves
    *   B. and **become as little children**,
        *   C. and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and **through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent**.
            *   D. For **the natural man**
                *   E. is an enemy to **God**,
                    *   F. and **has been** from the fall of Adam,
                    *   F. and **will be**, forever and ever,
                *   E. unless he yields to the enticings of **the Holy Spirit**,
            *   D. and putteth off **the natural man**
        *   C. and becometh a saint through **the atonement of Christ the Lord**,
    *   B. and **becometh as a child**,
*   A. submissive, meek, **humble**...

## Mosiah 5:10-12

*   A. Whosoever shall not take upon him **the name** of Christ
    *   B. must be **called** by some other name;
        *   C. therefore, he **findeth himself on the left hand of God**.
            *   D. And I would that ye should **remember** also, that this is **the name**
                *   E. that I said I should give unto you that never should be **blotted out**,
                    *   F. except it be through **transgression**;
                    *   F. therefore, take heed that ye do not **transgress**,
                *   E. that the name be not **blotted out** of your hearts.
            *   D. I say unto you, I would that ye should **remember** to retain **the name** written always in your hearts,
        *   C. that ye are not **found on the left hand of God**,
    *   B. but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be **called**,
*   A. and also, **the name** by which he shall call you.

## Mosiah 11:20-25 (see also [Prophetic Speech Forms](prophetic_speech_forms.md#mosiah-1120-25-see-also-chiasmus))

*   A. Behold, **thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me**, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord—Wo be unto this people,
    *   for **I have seen** *their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms*; 
        *   and **except they repent** I will visit them in mine anger.
            *   And **except** they repent and turn to **the Lord their God**,
                *   behold, **I will deliver them** into the hands of their enemies;
                    *   yea, and **they shall be brought into bondage**; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.
                        *   And it shall come to pass that they shall know that **I am the Lord their God**, and am a jealous God, 
                            *   visiting **the iniquities of my people**.
                            *   And it shall come to pass that except **this people repent**
                        *   and turn unto **the Lord their God**,
                    *   **they shall be brought into bondage**;
                *   and **none shall deliver them**,
            *   **except** it be **the Lord the Almighty God**.
        *   Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies. And **except they repent** in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God,
    *   **I will not hear** *their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions*;
*   A. and **thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me**.

## Alma 9:12 (see also [Word Pairs](word_pairs.md#alma-912-see-also-chiasmus))

*   A. yea, **he will visit you**
    *   B. **in his anger**,
    *   B. and **in his fierce anger**
*   A. **he will not turn away**

## Alma 34:10

*   A. There should be a **great and last sacrifice**;
    *   B. yea, not a **sacrifice of man**,
        *   C. neither of **beast**,
        *   C. neither of any manner of **fowl**;
    *   B. for it shall not be a **human sacrifice**;
*   A. but it must be an **infinite and eternal sacrifice**.

## Alma 36

*   A. My son, give ear to **my words**; (v. 1)
    *   B. for I swear unto you, that **inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land**. (v. 1)
        *   C. **I would that ye should do as I have done**, (v. 2)
            *   D. in **remembering the captivity of our fathers**; (v. 2)
                *   E. for they were in **bondage**, and none could **deliver them** except it was the God of **Abraham**, and the God of **Isaac**, and the God of **Jacob**; (v. 2)
                    *   F. and he surely did **deliver *them*** in their afflictions. (v. 2)
                        *   G. And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall **put their trust in God** (v. 3)
                            *   H. shall be supported in their **trials**, and their **troubles**, and their **afflictions**, (v. 3)
                                *   I. and **shall be lifted up at the last day**. (v. 3)
                                    *   J. And I would not that ye think that I **know** of myself—not of the temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal **mind** but **of God**. (v. 4)
                                        *   K. Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been **born of God** I should not have known these things; (v. 5)
                                            *   L. but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, **made these things known unto me**, not of any worthiness of myself; (v. 5)
                                                *   M. For **I went about** with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to **destroy the church of God**; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way. (v. 6)
                                                       
                                                       And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us. (v. 7)
                                                       
                                                       But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel. (v. 8)
                                                       
                                                       And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God. (v. 9)
                                                    *   N. And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of **my limbs**. (v. 10)
                                                        *   O. And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words—If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God—I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more. (v. 11)
                                                        
                                                            But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins. (v. 12)
                                                        
                                                            Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments. (v. 13)
                                                        
                                                            Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that **the very thought of coming into the presence of my God** did rack my soul with inexpressible horror. (v. 14)
                                                        
                                                            Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that **I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God**, to be judged of my deeds. (v. 15)
                                                            *   P. And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the **pains** of a damned soul. (v. 16)
                                                                *   Q. And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was **harrowed up by the memory of my many sins**, (v. 17)
                                                                    *   R. behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one **Jesus Christ, a Son of God**, to atone for the sins of the world. (v. 17)
                                                                    *   R. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O **Jesus, thou Son of God**, ahave mercy on me, who am bin the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. (v. 18)
                                                                *   Q. And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was **harrowed up by the memory of my sins** no more. (v. 19)
                                                            *   P. And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my **pain**\! (v. 20)

                                                                Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were **my pains**. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy. (v. 21)
                                                        *   O. Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, **God** sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their **God**; yea, and **my soul did long to be there**. (v. 22)
                                                    *   N. But behold, **my limbs** did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God. (v. 23)
                                                *   M. Yea, and from that time even until now, **I have labored** without ceasing, that I might **bring souls unto repentance**; that I might bring them to btaste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. (v. 24)
                                                
                                                    Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of **my labors**; (v. 25)
                                            *   L. For because of **the word which he has imparted unto me**, (v. 26)
                                        *   K. behold, many have **been born of God**, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; (v. 26)
                                    *   J. therefore they do **know** of these things of which I have spoken, as I do **know**; and the **knowledge** which I have is **of God**. (v. 26)
                            *   H. And I have been supported under **trials** and **troubles** of every kind, yea, and in all manner of **afflictions**; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; (v. 27)
                        *   G. yea, and I do **put my trust in him**, (v. 27)
                    *   F. and he will still **deliver *me***. (v. 27)
                                *   I. And I know that he **will raise me up at the last day**, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, (v. 28)
                *   E. for he has brought **our fathers** out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has **delivered them** out of **bondage** and captivity from time to time. (v. 28)
                
                    Yea, and he has also brought **our fathers** out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, **delivered them** out of **bondage** and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; (v. 29)
            *   D. and I have always retained **in remembrance their captivity**; (v. 29)
        *   C. yea, and **ye also ought to** retain in remembrance, **as I have done**, their captivity. (v. 29)
    *   B. But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that **inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land**; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence. (v. 30)
*   A. Now this is according to **his word**. (v. 30)

## Alma 34:9

*   A. For **it is expedient that an atonement should be made**;
    *   B. for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be **an atonement** made,
        *   C. or else all mankind **must unavoidably perish**;
            *   D. yea, **all are hardened**;
            *   D. yea, **all are fallen and are lost**,
        *   C. and **must perish**
    *   B. except it be through **the atonement**
*   A. which **it is expedient should be made**.

## Helaman 6:7-13

*   A. And behold, **there was peace in all the land**,
insomuch that the Nephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites or the Lamanites.
    *   B. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one with another, to buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to their desire. **[Freedom of travel and trade in both lands]**
        *   C. And it came to pass that **they became exceedingly rich**, both the Lamanites and the Nephites;
            *   D. and **they did have an exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious metals**, both in the land south and in the land north.
                *   E. Now **the land south**
                    *   F. was called **Lehi**, and
                        *   G. **the land north**
                            *   H. was called **Mulek**, which was after the son of Zedekiah;
                            *   H. for the Lord did bring **Mulek**
                        *   G. into **the land north**,
                    *   F. and **Lehi**
                *   E. into **the land south**.
            *   D. And behold, **there was all manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind**; and there were also curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it;
        *   C. and thus **they did become rich**.
    *   B. They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And they did multiply and wax exceedingly strong in the land. And they did raise many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings. Behold their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness. **[Economic prosperity in both lands]**
*   A. And thus **the sixty and fourth year did pass away in peace**.

        *   C. Yea, they **shall be rent in twain**,
