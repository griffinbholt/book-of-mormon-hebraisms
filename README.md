# Book of Mormon Hebraisms

*Hebraisms and Other Ancient Literary Forms in the Book of Mormon*

This repository is set up to mirror the sections in the book
*Preserved in Translation* by Donald W. Parry, but to include many more examples
than his book includes.

These examples are pulled from his book, from Book of Mormon Central, from
various research papers, and from my own study of the Book of Mormon.
