# Inverted Quotations (aka "Seidel's Law")

## Quotations of Old Testament

### Original: Genesis
The order of creation, as outlined in Genesis 1-2, is:
*   a. **The earth**
*   b. **The fowls**
*   c. **The beasts**
*   d. The pinnacle of creation, **man and woman**

### Quotation: 2 Nephi 2:15
*   And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man,
*   d. after he had created **our first parents**,
*   c. and **the beasts** of the field
*   b. and **the fowls** of the air,
*   a. and in fine, **all things which are created**,
*   it must needs be there was an opposition

#### Notes:

Even though this isn't a direct quotation, the inverted recitation of phases
of the creation mirrors the same pattern Moses uses in Deuteronomy 4:15–19 when referencing the creation to teach his people.

If you consider the entire Plan of Salvation as revealed in Moses (elements
of which were known to Lehi), then the first element in Lehi's list above
"his eternal purposes in the end of man" describes what is known the be the
final and eternal destiny of man (see Moses 1:39); similarly, in the
beginning, preceding creation, there was opposition in heaven (Moses 4:3-4)

Thus, we could consider this instead as a quotation of the creation account
as outlined in Moses 1-4:
*   a. The **war of agency** in heaven (Moses 4:3-4)
*   b. **The earth**
*   c. **The fowls**
*   d. **The beasts**
*   e. The pinnacle of creation, **man and woman**
*   f. The **eternal destiny of man** after creation (Moses 1:39)

Then, the quotation in 2 Nephi 2:15 is seen to be a direct reverse of the
creation account in Moses:
*   f. And to bring about **his eternal purposes in the end of man**,
*   e. after he had created **our first parents**,
*   d. and **the beasts** of the field
*   c. and **the fowls** of the air,
*   b. and in fine, **all things which are created**,
*   a. it must needs be there was **an opposition**
