*   Wherefore, they must be brought to *stand before God*,
*   to be judged of *their works*;
*   and if *their works* have been *filthiness*,
*   they must needs be *filthy*;
*   and if they be *filthy*,
*   it must needs be that they cannot dwell in *the kingdom of God*;
*   if so, *the kingdom of God* must be *filthy* also.
*   But behold, I say unto you, *the kingdom of God *is *not filthy*,
*   and there cannot any *unclean* thing enter into *the kingdom of God*;
*   wherefore there must needs be *a place of filthiness* prepared for that which is *filthy*.
*   And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of which I have spoken

## 2 Nephi 2:13

*   And if ye shall say there is *no law*,
*   ye shall also say there is *no sin*.
*   If ye shall say there is *no sin*,
*   ye shall also say there is *no righteousness*.
*   And if there be *no righteousness*
*   there be *no happiness*.
*   And if there be *no righteousness nor happiness*
*   there be no *punishment nor misery*.
*   And if *these things* are not
*   there is *no God*.
*   And if there is *no God*
*   *we* are not, neither *the earth*;
*   for there could have been no creation of *things*, neither *to act* nor *to be acted upon*;
*   wherefore, all things must have vanished away.

## 2 Nephi 9:25-26

*   Wherefore, he has given *a law*;
*   and there there is *no law* given,
*   there is *no punishment*;
*   and where there is *no punishment*
*   there is *no condemnation*;
*   and where there is *no condemnation*
*   the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of *the atonement*.
*   For *the atonement* satisfieth the demands of his just
*   upon all those who have not *the law* given unto them...


## Alma 42:22-23

*   But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed,
*   and *repentance* granted;
*   which *repentance*, *mercy* claimeth;
*   otherwise, *justice* claimeth the creature and executeth *the law*,
*   and *the law* inflicteth *the punishment*;
*   if not so, the works of *justice* would be destroyed,
*   and *God* would cease to be *God*.
*   But *God* ceaseth not to be *God*,
*   and *mercy* claimeth the penitent,
*   and *mercy* cometh because of *the atonement*;
*   and *the atonement* bringeth to pass *the resurrection of the dead*;
*   and *the resurrection of the dead* bringeth back men into *the presence of God*;
*   and thus they are restored into *his presence*,
*   to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.

## Helaman 5:6-7

*   Behold, I have given unto you *the names* of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem;
*   and this I have done that when you *remember your names* ye may *remember them*;
*   and when ye *remember them* ye may *remember their works*;
*   and when ye *remember their works* ye may know how
*   that it is *said, and also written*, that they were *good*.
*   Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is *good*,
*   that it may be *said of you, and also written*,
*   even as it has been *said and written of them*.

## Helaman 15:7-8

*   And behold, ye do *know* of yourselves, for ye have witnessed it,
*   that as many of them as are brought to the *knowledge of the truth*,
*   and to know of *the wicked and abominable traditions* of their fathers,
*   and are led to believe *the holy scriptures*,
*   yea, *the prophecies* of the holy prophets, which are written,
*   which leadeth them to *faith on the Lord, and unto repentance*,
*   which *faith and repentance* bringeth *a change of heart* unto themâ€”
*   Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made free.

# Ether 3:15-16

*   And *never* have I ashowed myself
*   unto *man* whom I have *created*,
*   for *never* has *man* *believed*
*   in me as *thou* hast.
*   Seest *thou* that ye are *created*
*   *after mine own image*?
*   Yea, even *all men* were *created*
*   in the beginning *after mine own image*.
*   Behold, *this body*, which ye now behold,
*   is *the body of my spirit*;
*   and man have I created after *the body of my spirit*;
*   and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.

*   And because of *the redemption of man*, which came by Jesus Christ,
*   they are brought back into the presence of the Lord;

## Moroni 8:25-26

*   And the first fruits of *repentance* is *baptism*;
*   and *baptism* cometh by faith unto *the fulfilling the commandments*;
*   and *the fulfilling the commandments* bringeth *remission of sins*;
*   and the *remission of sins* bringeth *meekness, and lowliness of heart*;
*   and because of *meekness and lowliness of heart* cometh the visitation of *the Holy Ghost*,
*   which *Comforter* filleth with hope and perfect *love*,
*   which *love* endureth by diligence unto prayer,
*   until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.
