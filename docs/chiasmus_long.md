## Mosiah 2:9-28

### A. Purpose of the assembly

*   a. My brethren, all ye that have **assembled yourselves together**,
    *   b. you that can hear my **words which I shall speak** unto you this day;
*   a. for I have not **commanded you to come up hither**
    *   b. to trifle with the **words which I shall speak**,
*   but that you should hearken unto me,
*   and open your ears that ye may hear,
*   and your hearts that ye may understand,
*   and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.
*   a. I have not **commanded you to come up hither** that ye should fear me,

### B. What is man?

*   a. or that ye should think that I of myself
    *   b. am more than a mortal man.
*   a. But I am like as yourselves,
    *   b. subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind;
*   yet I have been chosen by this people, 
*   and consecrated by my father,
*   and was suffered by the hand of the Lord
*   that I should be a ruler and a king over this people;
*   and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.


12 I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;
13 Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you—
14 And even I, myself, have labored with mine own bhands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be claden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne—and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.
15 Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might aboast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear bconscience before God this day.
16 Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.
17 And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn awisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the bservice of your cfellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.
18 Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to aserve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?
19 And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to athank your heavenly bKing!
20 I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the athanks and bpraise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and cpreserved you, and has caused that ye should drejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another—
21 I say unto you that if ye should aserve him who has created you from the beginning, and is bpreserving you from day to day, by lending you cbreath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own dwill, and even supporting you from one moment to another—I say, if ye should serve him with all your ewhole souls yet ye would be funprofitable servants.
22 And behold, all that he arequires of you is to bkeep his commandments; and he has cpromised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth dvary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do ekeep his fcommandments he doth bless you and prosper you.

### B. What is man?

*   And now, in the first place,
    *   he hath created you,
    *   and granted unto you your lives,
    *  for which ye are indebted unto him.
*   And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do,
    * he doth immediately bless you;
    * and therefore he hath paid you
    * and ye are still indebted unto him,
*   and are, and will be, forever and ever;
*   therefore, of what have ye to boast?
*   a. And now I ask,
    * b. can ye say aught of yourselves?
*   a. I answer you,
    * b. Nay. Ye cannot say
*   a. that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth;
    *   b. yet ye were created
*   a. of the dust of the earth;
    *   b. but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.
*   And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are;
*   a. for I am also of the dust.
    *   b. And ye behold that I am old,
    *   b. and am about to yield up this mortal frame
*   a. to its mother earth.

### A. Purpose of the Assembly

*   Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time **have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together**,
*   that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be **judged** of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.
*   I say unto you that I **have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together**
*   that I might rid my garments of your **blood**, at this period of time when I am about to **go down** to my grave,
*   that I might **go down** in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a **just** God.
