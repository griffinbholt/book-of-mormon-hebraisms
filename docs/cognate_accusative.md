# Cognate Accusative

## Explanation

"It is typical in Biblical Hebrew for a verb and object in a sentence to share
the same origin or root, a grammatical usage known as the 'cognate accusative'...
Although English grammar allows the cognate accusative, its use is not common.
Its presence in the Book of Mormon does not come from English and, in fact, is
not surprising given the Hebrew roots of Nephite writing" - Donald W. Parry,
