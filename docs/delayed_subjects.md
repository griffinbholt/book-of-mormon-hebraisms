<!-- TODO: Explore the instances of "and also" that are somewhere between
    this and a full clause, like 1 Nephi 16:7 or 1 Nephi 18:19 -->
<!-- TODO: It may be worth creating a separate list for "Delayed Clauses",
    not just "Delayed Subjects", which show narrative afterthought (see Alma 17:6) -->
<!-- TODO: "and also is the devil an enemy to God" in Mosiah 16:5 is such
    a strange way to word it. Is it Hebraic? See also Alma 23:14 -->
<!-- TODO: I think that "Delayed Objects" are of the same format as "Delayed
    Subjects". I'd be interested to know if that is true in Hebrew writings
    outside the Book of Mormon. See 3 Nephi 20:1; Ether 6:6 -->
<!-- TODO: There is also a pattern of delayed subjects where the delayed
    subject is added, but then the sentence/action is repeated (see 3 Nephi 10:16; also 10:18) -->

<!-- TODO: I don't think any of Jesus' words were afterthoughts or delayed
    subjects - he didn't forget anyone (test that out) -->
