## 1 Nephi 9:2 ("Plates")

And now, as I have spoken concerning these **plates**, behold they are not the
**plates** upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the
**plates** upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name
of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the **plates** of Nephi, after mine own name;
and these **plates** also are called the **plates** of Nephi.

*   A. and if their works have been **filthiness**
    *   B. they must needs be **filthy**;
        *   C. and if they be **filthy** it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God;
            *   D. if so, the kingdom of God must be **filthy** also.
            *   But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not **filthy**,
        *   C. and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God;
    *   B. wherefore there must needs be a place of **filthiness**
*   A. prepared for that which is **filthy**.

## Mosiah 1:11-12; 3:8,9,17,21; 4:11,20; 5:7-12,14,15; 6:1-2 ("Name" / "the name of Christ"; this is King Benjamin's Sermon)

And moreover, I shall give this people **a name**, that thereby they may be
distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the
land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in
keeping the commandments of the Lord. (1:11)

And I give unto them **a name** that never shall be blotted out, except it be
through transgression... (1:12)

And **he shall be called Jesus Christ**, the Son of God, the Father of heaven
and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall
be called Mary. (3:8)

And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of
men even through faith on **his name**... (3:9)

And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other **name** given nor
any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men,
only in and through **the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent**... (3:17)

And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God,
except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on **the name
of the Lord God Omnipotent**... (3:21)

...humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on **the name of
the Lord** daily... (4:11)

And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his **name**, and begging
for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain?
Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you... (4:20)

And now, because of the covenant which ye have made **ye shall be called the
children of Christ**, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath
spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through
faith on **his name**; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and
his daughters. (5:7)

And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can
be made free. There is no other **name** given whereby salvation cometh;
therefore, I would that ye should take upon you **the name of Christ**, all you
that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto
the end of your lives. (5:8)

And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right
hand of God, for he shall know the **name** by which he is called; for he shall
be called by **the name of Christ**. (5:9)

And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him
**the name of Christ** must be called by some aother **name**; therefore, he
findeth himself on the left hand of God. (5:10)

And I would that ye should remember also, that this is **the name** that I said
I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through
transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that **the name**
be not blotted out of your hearts. (5:11)

I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain **the name** written
always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that
ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, **the name** by
which he shall call you... (5:12)

And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him?
I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his
flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so
shall it be among you if ye know not the **name** by which ye are called. (5:14)

Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding
in agood works, that **Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent**, may seal you **his**,
that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and
eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who
created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen. (5:15)

And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished speaking
to the people, that he should take **the names** of all those who had entered
into a covenant with God to keep his commandments. (6:1)

And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were little children,
but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them **the name of
Christ**. (6:2)

## Mosiah 4:9-10 ("Believe"; see also [Refrain](refrain.md#mosiah-49-see-also-theme-words))

**Believe** in God; **believe** that he is, and that he created all things, both
in heaven and in earth; **believe** that he has all wisdom, and all power, both
in heaven and in earth; **believe** that man doth not comprehend all the things
which the Lord can comprehend.

And again, **believe** that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and
humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would
forgive you; and now, if you **believe** all these things see that ye do them.

## Mosiah 11:3 ("Fifth")

And he laid a tax of one **fifth** part of all they possessed, a **fifth** part
of their gold and of their silver, and a **fifth** part of their ziff, and of
their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a **fifth** part of their
fatlings; and also a **fifth** part of all their grain.

#### Notes:

It's interesting that it says "fifth" five times, summing up to a total of one
whole.

## Alma 5:57-58 ("Names")

And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the
good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not
their unclean things; and behold, their **names** shall be blotted out, that the
**names** of the wicked shall not be numbered among the **names** of the righteous,
that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The **names** of the wicked
shall not be mingled with the **names** of my people;

For the **names** of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto
them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand.

## Alma 13:1-16 ("Order" / "Ordained" / "Ordinance")

And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the
Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should
remember that the Lord God **ordained** priests, after his holy **order**, which was
after the **order** of his Son, to teach these things unto the people. (v. 1)

And those priests were **ordained** after the **order** of his Son, in a manner
that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son
for redemption. (v. 2)

And this is the manner after which they were **ordained**—being called and
prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of
God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works... (v. 3)

And thus being called by this holy calling, and **ordained** unto the high
priesthood of the holy **order** of God, to teach his commandments unto the
children of men, that they also might enter into his rest— (v. 6)

This high priesthood being after the **order** of his Son, which **order** was
from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of
days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according
to his foreknowledge of all things— (v. 7)

Now they were **ordained** after this manner—being called with a holy calling, and
**ordained** with a holy **ordinance**, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the
holy **order**, which calling, and **ordinance**, and high priesthood, is without
beginning or end— (v. 8)

Thus they become high priests forever, after the **order** of the Son, the
Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years,
who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen. (v. 9)

Now, as I said concerning the holy **order**, or this high priesthood, there
were many who were **ordained** and became high priests of God; and it was on
account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before
God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish; (v. 10)

Therefore they were called after this holy **order**, and were sanctified,
and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb... (v. 11)

Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was
also a high priest after this same **order** which I have spoken, who also took
upon him the high priesthood forever... (v. 14)

Now these **ordinances** were given after this manner, that thereby the people
might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his **order**,
or it being his **order**, and this that they might look forward to him for a
remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord. (v. 16)

## Alma 19:6 ("Light")

Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was under the
power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from
his mind, and the **light** which did **light** up his mind, which was the
**light** of the glory of God, which was a marvelous **light** of his goodness–
yea, this **light** had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness
having been dispelled, and that the **light** of everlasting life was **lit** up
in his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was
carried away in God–

## Alma 27:17-18 ("Joy")

Now the **joy** of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he was
swallowed up in the **joy** of his God, even to the exhausting of his strength;
and he fell again to the earth.

Now was not this exceeding **joy**? Behold, this is **joy** which none
receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of bhappiness.

## Alma 48:11 ("Man")

And Moroni was a strong and a mighty **man**; he was a **man** of a perfect
understanding; yea, a **man** that did not delight in bloodshed; a **man**
whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his
brethren from bondage and slavery;

## Helaman 5:5-14 ("Remember")

For they **remembered** the words which their father Helaman spake unto them.
And these are the words which he spake: (v. 5)

Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should **remember** to keep the commandments
of God; ...and this I have done that when you ***remember*** your names ye may
**remember** them; and when ye **remember** them ye may **remember** their
works; and when ye **remember** their works ye may know how that it is said,
and also written, that they were good... (v. 6)

O **remember**, **remember**, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto
his people; yea, **remember** that there is no other way nor means whereby man
can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come;
yea, **remember** that he cometh to redeem the world. (v. 9)

And **remember** also the words which Amulek spake... (v. 10)

And now, my sons, **remember**, **remember**... (v. 12)

And they did **remember** his words; (v. 14)

## Helaman 13:19 ("Treasures")

For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their **treasures** unto me;
and cursed be they who hide not up their **treasures** unto me; for none hideth
up their **treasures** unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not
up his **treasures** unto me, cursed is he, and also the **treasure**, and none
shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.

## 3 Nephi 11:3 ("Voice")

And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another,
they heard a **voice** as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes
round about, for they understood not the **voice** which they heard; and it was
not a **harsh** voice, neither was it a loud **voice**; nevertheless, and
notwithstanding it being a small **voice** it did pierce them that did hear to
the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not
cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their
hearts to burn.

## 3 Nephi 27:14-15 ("Lifted Up")

And my Father sent me that I might be **lifted up** upon the cross; and after
that I had been **lifted up** upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me,
that as I have been **lifted up** by men even so should men be **lifted up** by
the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be
good or whether they be evil—

And for this cause have I been **lifted up**; therefore, according to the power
of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according
to their works.

## Mormon 9:26 ("Who")

And now, behold
*   **who** can stand against the works of the Lord?
*   **Who** can deny his sayings?
*   **Who** will rise up against the almighty power of the Lord?
*   **Who** will despise the works of the Lord?
*   **Who** will despise the children of Christ?
