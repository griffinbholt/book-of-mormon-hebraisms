*   and at the time they **proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew**, or,
*   at the time the book **proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew**,

the things which were written were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the understanding of all men.

There arose *a great storm*, such an one as **never had been known in all the land**.

And there were *exceedingly sharp lightnings*, such as **never had been known in all the land**.

## 3 Nephi 9:5,7,8,11

And behold, *that great city Moronihah* have I *covered with earth*, and the
inhabitants thereof,
*   **to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before my face,
    that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come any more
    unto me against them.**

Yea, and *the city of Onihah* and the inhabitants thereof, and *the city of Mocum*
and the inhabitants thereof, and *the city of Jerusalem* and the inhabitants
thereof; and *waters have I caused to come up* in the stead thereof,
*   **to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face,
    that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come up any more
    unto me against them.**

And behold, *the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and the city of
Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno*, all these have I *caused to be sunk*, and made
hills and valleys in the places thereof; and the inhabitants thereof have I
buried up in the depths of the earth,
*   **to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face,
    that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up any more
    unto me against them.**

And because they did cast them all out, that there were none righteous among
them, I did *send down fire and destroy them*,
*   **that their wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my face,
    that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent among them might not cry
    unto me from the ground against them.**

## 3 Nephi 10:1-2

And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear these
sayings, and did witness of it.

And after these sayings **there was silence in the land for the space of many hours**;

For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting
and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain;

therefore **there was silence in all the land for the space of many hours**.

*   B. O ye people of these great cities
    *   i. which have fallen,
    *   ii. who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel,

    *   i. whom I have spared,
*   A. **how oft *will I* gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings**,
    *   iii. if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of cheart.
