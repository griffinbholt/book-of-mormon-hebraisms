## 1 Nephi 9:2 ("Plates")

And now, as I have spoken concerning these **plates**, behold they are not the
**plates** upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the
**plates** upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name
of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the **plates** of Nephi, after mine own name;
and these **plates** also are called the **plates** of Nephi.

## Mosiah 4:9-10 ("Believe")

**Believe** in God; **believe** that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; **believe** that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; **believe** that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.

And again, **believe** that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you **believe** all these things see that ye do them.

**remember** them; and when ye **remember** them ye may **remember** their
works; and when ye **remember** their works ye may know how that it is said,
and also written, that they were good... (v. 6)

And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another,
they heard a **voice** as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes
round about, for they understood not the **voice** which they heard; and it was
not a **harsh** voice, neither was it a loud **voice**; nevertheless, and
notwithstanding it being a small **voice** it did pierce them that did hear to
the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not
cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their
hearts to burn.
